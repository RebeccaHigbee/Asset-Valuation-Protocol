Crime data derived from the ""Crimes in Washington"" annual report (by year) compiled from data submitted to the Washington State Uniform Crime Reporting Program of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs by Washington State law enforcement agencies. 

Only specific crimes are highlighted in the crime rates presented here. These numbers represent total numbers of reported crimes in each category (not arrests which may occur over a prolonged period). 

The following categories represent the violent crimes considered in this data: Murder, Manslaughter, Forcible Sex, Assault, Kidnapping/Abduction, Human Trafficking, and Robbery.

The following categories represent the property crimes considered in this data: Burglary, Theft, Arson, and Destruction of Property. 

Each set of crimes is totaled, then the rate per 1,000 people is calculated using the total # of crimes and the current population of each jurisdiction per year as provided in the same report.

Crime data derived from the ""Crimes in Washington"" annual report (by year) compiled from data submitted to the Washington State Uniform Crime Reporting Program of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs by Washington State law enforcement agencies. 

Only specific crimes are highlighted in the crime rates presented here. These numbers represent total numbers of reported crimes in each category (not arrests which may occur over a prolonged period). 

The following categories represent the violent crimes considered in this data: Murder, Manslaughter, Forcible Sex, Assault, Kidnapping/Abduction, Human Trafficking, and Robbery.

The following categories represent the property crimes considered in this data: Burglary, Theft, Arson, and Destruction of Property. 

Each set of crimes is totaled, then the rate per 1,000 people is calculated using the total # of crimes and the current population of each jurisdiction per year as provided in the same report.

y9nd-25u9,Zoning,"<DIV STYLE=""text-align:Left;font-size:12pt""><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>This data identifies current as well as proposed zoning and land use designations that are adopted by ordinances for unincorporated Pierce County. Zoning for cities is not included in this dataset. Zones are adopted by ordinances with specific technicalities for each community. Land Use designations offer a broad spectrum of allowable uses within a community. It is used to create a Comprehensive Plan Map or used for a Generalized Proposed Land Use Map or GPLUM. This dataset is also used to create the Land Use Designations theme, which covers proposed zoning use. The meaning of proposed is that the property might not be currently used for the purpose stated. It should be noted that Council adopted amendments to land use designations/zoning that will be effective at the beginning of 2006. Also, the Council is in the process of adopting the Mid-County Community Plan which amends land use designations/zoning as well. The Cities polygons found in the zoning data does not necessarily match the current cities boundaries. This is because the zoning data is updated once a year per the ""Pierce County Comprehensive Plan"" and does not allow for changes to be made during the year. The Comprehensive Plan is generally updated in November and generally becomes effective the following March. Use the ""Cities in Pierce County"" data set to determine current city boundaries. City boundaries can change more often than the current adopted Pierce County Zoning data. The zoning data contains the ""Cities in Pierce County"" boundaries at the time that the Pierce County Zoning was adopted. When determining the current zoning of a parcel near a city, the current ""Cities in Pierce County"" data set needs to be reviewed. Zoning codes for parcels within incorporated cities are determined by the city that the parcel is within.

rnph-cedi,Floodplain Seclusion Areas,"Areas within the seclusion boundary retain the mapping and flood hazard analysis from the 1970s that appears on FIRMs issued to Pierce County communities from 1980 to 1987. Seclusion boundaries are shown in Unincorporated Pierce County, Tacoma, Port of Tacoma, Fife, Puyallup and Orting. This is due to the presents of levees that affect flooding but are not certified or accredited to protect areas behind them from the 1% Annual Chance Flood per 44 CFR 65.10. While FEMA develops a new engineering and mapping standard for these levees no new adoption of flood risk hazards will occur in the secluded areas. Flood hazards shown on original FIRMs have been digitized into this preliminary DFIRM and previously approved LOMRs have been incorporated. This is the 2017 DFIRM Data showing areas of at risk of flooding. New to the DFIRM data set from 2009 is the a coastal flood study, that adds Velocity Zones (VE) along Puget Sound and Seclusion Boundary in areas affected by non-accredited levees retain 1970s modeled flood hazards. **This data is for informational purposes only - for regulated flood hazard areas see ""Regulated Floodplain 2017” The Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual- chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system. The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000.

xry5-u4y4,SimCon First Division,"<DIV STYLE=""text-align:Left;font-size:12pt""><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>""SimCon First Division"" is short for ""Simultaneous Conveyance First Division"". It is part of a set of data called ""Land Division - All"". Please read through all of the following to fully understand what this data is. A conveyance is the transferring of legal title of property from person(s) or entity to another. A ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" is the transfer of multiple properties using a single survey document. Examples of this are plats, short plats, condominiums, etc. The ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" data contains the current aggregated highest-level formal land divisions (plats, short plats, large lots, etc). Meaning that the most recent ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" type is what is represented in this data. In other words, there are no overlapping ""Simultaneous Conveyances"" in this data, a newer ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" erases what was present before at that location.

s8hz-mfcr,SimCon First Division,"<DIV STYLE=""text-align:Left;font-size:12pt""><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>""SimCon First Division"" is short for ""Simultaneous Conveyance First Division"". It is part of a set of data called ""Land Division - All"". Please read through all of the following to fully understand what this data is. A conveyance is the transferring of legal title of property from person(s) or entity to another. A ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" is the transfer of multiple properties using a single survey document. Examples of this are plats, short plats, condominiums, etc. The ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" data contains the current aggregated highest-level formal land divisions (plats, short plats, large lots, etc). Meaning that the most recent ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" type is what is represented in this data. In other words, there are no overlapping ""Simultaneous Conveyances"" in this data, a newer ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" erases what was present before at that location. There are two data sets related to the ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" data: ""SimCon First Division"" and ""SimCon Second Division"".

We were able to draw this feature class based on that definition by using a combination of the 2011 LIDAR imagery, 2-foot contours and orthophotos (new and historical).

7nc3-szu2,Channel Migration Zone Floodway,"As part of a Channel Migration Zone Study, GeoEngineers, Inc. was contracted by Pierce County, Public Works Surface Water Management formerly “Water Programs” Division to create a series of shapefiles including the SPC_Migration_Potential_Areas.shp.  Pierce_Migration_Potential_Areas.shp combines the include severe, moderate or low migration potential areas. GeoEngineers, Inc. completed migration potential studies of the White, Puyallup and Carbon Rivers (completed 2003 adopted 2005), South Prairie Creek (completed 2005 adopted 2017) and Upper Nisqually River (completed 2007 adopted 2017).  These were accepted by SWM and Adopted by County Council.The MPA delineation involved identifying severe, moderate and low migration potential areas within the delineated CMZ.  The MPA delineation approach is similar to that employed in our CMZ analysis; that future rates and character of migration will be similar to those of the past for similar water discharges, sediment influx, and debris entrainment conditions.  This analysis was also based on the absence of levees, revetments and other confining structures.  The width of each MPA was measured, based on delineation criteria developed specifically for this project, and then adjusted to accommodate geomorphic conditions not accounted for in the maximum migration rates.  Criteria developed for mapping severe, moderate and low MPA are provided in the following paragraphs: Severe MPA includes the area lying inside the HCOT, and an area immediately outside the HCOT boundary equivalent to a distance the channel could travel in a specified period.  The extent of the Severe Migration Potential Area outside the HCOT boundary is determined by two criteria.  The first criterion is the distance the outside channel edge could travel in 10 years of steady lateral migration away from the HCOT boundary (Maximum lateral migration rates multiplied by a ten- year period).  The second is defined by the distance the outside channel edge could travel in storm single event (i.e. maximum overnight rate) from the current channel position (2002).  The landward most boundary of the two criteria defines the Severe Migration Potential Area.Moderate MPA includes areas adjacent to the outside edge of the severe migration potential area.  The width of the moderate migration potential area is determined by the distance the outside channel edge could travel in five years (for South Prairie Creek 10 years) of steady lateral migration beyond the outside edge of the severe migration potential area.  The CMZ boundary will serve as the outside edge of the moderate migration potential boundary at sites where the distance between the severe migration potential boundary and the CMZ boundary represents less the five years (for South Prairie Creek 10 years)of steady lateral migration.  Moderate migration potential areas are not included at sites where the outside edge of the severe migration potential area is determined by the location of the CMZ boundary.  The rate of migration used in the calculation is the maximum average rate of migration for each geomorphic reach (measured as described above).  In some places the width of the Moderate Migration Potential Area may be modified based on geologic interpretation, professional judgment. Low MPA includes areas adjacent to the outside edge of the moderate migration potential area.  The extent of the Low Migration Potential Area beyond the moderate migration potential boundary will be determined by CMZ boundary, as determined by our CMZ evaluation.  Low migration potential areas will not be included at sites where the outside edge of either a severe or moderate migration potential area is determined by the location of the CMZ boundary. The most common adjustments typically involved widening the moderate MPA to include ancient abandoned channel deemed capable of arresting main stem flow in an avulsion event.  Other common Moderate MPA adjustments involved increasing or decreasing the ba",Joey Bisig,kgjv-98ni,published,public,approved,official,map,,,https://internal.open.piercecountywa.gov/d/7nc3-szu2,https://internal.open.piercecountywa.gov/resource/7nc3-szu2.json,05/09/2023 04:59:24 PM,06/30/2023 11:29:14 PM,05/09/2023 04:59:25 PM,internal.open.piercecountywa.gov,true,30,0,,,,,,,,,,s9ke-y5ir,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is part of a set of data called ""Land Division - All"". Please read through all of the following to fully understand what this data is. A conveyance is the transfering of legal title of property from person(s) or entity to another. A ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" is the transfer of multiple properties using a single survey document. Examples of this are plats, short plats, condiminiums, etc. The ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" data contains the current aggregated highest-level formal land divisions (plats, short plats, large lots, etc). Meaning that the most recent ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" type is what is represented in this data. In other words, there are no overlapping ""Simultaneous Conveyances"" in this data, a newer ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" erases what was present before at that location. There are two data sets related to the ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" data: ""SimCon First Division"" and ""SimCon Second Division"". ""SimCon First Division"" contains the next level down of polygons within the ""Simultaneous Conveyance"". For example a plat that contained blocks and lots would only have its blocks in this data. A plat that contained lots and no blocks would have its lots in this data. ""SimCon Second Division"" contains the next level down of polygons within the ""SimCon First Division"" data.

A ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" is the transfer of multiple properties using a single survey document. Examples of this are plats, short plats, condominiums, etc. This data is part of a set of data called ""Land Division - All"". The ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" data contains the current aggregated highest-level formal land divisions (plats, short plats, large lots, etc). Meaning that the most recent ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" type is what is represented in this data. In other words, there are no overlapping ""Simultaneous Conveyances"" in this data, a newer ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" erases what was present before at that location. There are two data sets related to the ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" data: ""SimCon First Division"" and ""SimCon Second Division"". ""SimCon First Division"" contains the next level down of polygons within the ""Simultaneous Conveyance"". For example a plat that contained blocks and lots would only have its blocks in this data. A plat that contained lots and no blocks would have its lots in this data. ""SimCon Second Division"" contains the next level down of polygons within the ""SimCon First Division"" data.

A conveyance is the transfering of legal title of property from person(s) or entity to another. A ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" is the transfer of multiple properties using a single survey document. Examples of this are plats, short plats, condiminiums, etc. The ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" data contains the current aggregated highest-level formal land divisions (plats, short plats, large lots, etc). Meaning that the most recent ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" type is what is represented in this data. In other words, there are no overlapping ""Simultaneous Conveyances"" in this data, a newer ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" erases what was present before at that location. There are two data sets related to the ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" data: ""SimCon First Division"" and ""SimCon Second Division"". ""SimCon First Division"" contains the next level down of polygons within the ""Simultaneous Conveyance"". For example a plat that contained blocks and lots would only have its blocks in this data.

ctij-m7sa,Floodplain Cross Sections,"This is 2017 DFIRM Data for cross section lines. New to the DFIRM data is the coastal flood study, that adds Velocity Zones (VE) along Puget Sound and the Seclusion Boundary. Seclusion areas are located where floodplains are affected by non-accredited levees and retain 1970s modeled flood hazards. These lines show the locations of channel surveys used to calculate flood elevations in the hydraulic models. The Cross Sections are also shown on the Flood Profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report and can be used to cross reference the Flood Profiles to the planimetric depiction of the flood hazards. All cross sections for which a spatial location is available should be included in the S_XS table. The Cross Sections are lines generally extending from outside the floodplain, across the entire floodplain and out the other side. In this data set the cross sections have been trimmed to include only the areas show to be in a flood hazard area. Each cross section is represented by a line feature. The line has been split where the modeling shows a different base flood elevation than the stream center on the left or right bank (reference 2017 FIS Volume 2). The Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event (Zones A & V), the 0.2-percent-annual- chance flood event (Zone X shaded), areas of undetermined flood risk (Zone X shaded) and areas of minimal flood risk (Zone X unshaded). The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system. The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000.

9rr8-x2ni,Floodplain Seclusion Areas,"Areas within the seclusion boundary retain the mapping and flood hazard analysis from the 1970s that appears on FIRMs issued to Pierce County communities from 1980 to 1987. Seclusion boundaries are shown in Unincorporated Pierce County, Tacoma, Port of Tacoma, Fife, Puyallup and Orting. This is due to the presents of levees that affect flooding but are not certified or accredited to protect areas behind them from the 1% Annual Chance Flood per 44 CFR 65.10. While FEMA develops a new engineering and mapping standard for these levees no new adoption of flood risk hazards will occur in the secluded areas. Flood hazards shown on original FIRMs have been digitized into this preliminary DFIRM and previously approved LOMRs have been incorporated. This is the 2017 DFIRM Data showing areas of at risk of flooding. New to the DFIRM data set from 2009 is the a coastal flood study, that adds Velocity Zones (VE) along Puget Sound and Seclusion Boundary in areas affected by non-accredited levees retain 1970s modeled flood hazards. **This data is for informational purposes only - for regulated flood hazard areas see ""Regulated Floodplain 2017” The Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual- chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system. The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000.

mnft-2np6,COM - Point-in-Time Volunteer Recruitment Online Registrants,"What is the Point-In-Time Count?

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Washington State Department of Commerce require communities to conduct a one-day Point-In-Time (PIT) Count to survey individuals experiencing homelessness. PIT Counts are one source of data among many that help us understand the magnitude and characteristics of people who are homeless in our community.

The Point-In-Time (PIT) Count is a one-day snapshot that captures the characteristics and situations of people living here without a home. The PIT Count includes both sheltered individuals (temporarily living in emergency shelters or transitional housing) and unsheltered individuals (those sleeping outside or living in places that are not meant for human habitation).

The annual PIT Count happens the last Friday in January, and is carried out by volunteers who interview people and asks where they slept the night before, where their last residence was located, what may have contributed to their loss of housing, and disabilities the individual may have. It also asks how long the individual has been homeless, age and demographics, and whether the person is a veteran and/or a survivor of domestic violence.

Like all surveys, the PIT Count has limitations.

thsn-dhgd,Zoning,"<DIV STYLE=""text-align:Left;font-size:12pt""><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>This data identifies current as well as proposed zoning and land use designations that are adopted by ordinances for unincorporated Pierce County. Zoning for cities is not included in this dataset. Zones are adopted by ordinances with specific technicalities for each community. Land Use designations offer a broad spectrum of allowable uses within a community. It is used to create a Comprehensive Plan Map or used for a Generalized Proposed Land Use Map or GPLUM. This dataset is also used to create the Land Use Designations theme, which covers proposed zoning use. The meaning of proposed is that the property might not be currently used for the purpose stated. It should be noted that Council adopted amendments to land use designations/zoning that will be effective at the beginning of 2006. Also, the Council is in the process of adopting the Mid-County Community Plan which amends land use designations/zoning as well. The Cities polygons found in the zoning data does not necessarily match the current cities boundaries. This is because the zoning data is updated once a year per the ""Pierce County Comprehensive Plan"" and does not allow for changes to be made during the year. The Comprehensive Plan is generally updated in November and generally becomes effective the following March. Use the ""Cities in Pierce County"" data set to determine current city boundaries. City boundaries can change more often than the current adopted Pierce County Zoning data. The zoning data contains the ""Cities in Pierce County"" boundaries at the time that the Pierce County Zoning was adopted. When determining the current zoning of a parcel near a city, the current ""Cities in Pierce County"" data set needs to be reviewed. Zoning codes for parcels within incorporated cities are determined by the city that the parcel is within.

wv3p-9k75,COM - Pierce County Media Sentiment,"The fundamental task in brand sentiment analysis is text classification – classifying the separation of a given text or whether the expressed opinion in a document is positive, negative, or neutral. Around 800 documents pass through our platform per second from different media sources and providers. We use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to judge which group (positive, negative or neutral) the content belongs to.

Meltwater’s Natural Language Processing model is supported by AI and machine learning algorithms. Using this model, we take individual words into account. Each document, for example, a tweet, is analysed based on the words it contains. Then we map the words to a set of predefined data to see the number of occurrences where they match up.",Kyle Schmidtke,i6dp-nubd,unpublished,private,not_ready,official,measure,,,https://internal.open.piercecountywa.gov/d/wv3p-9k75,,08/02/2019 09:40:46 AM,02/13/2020 12:28:57 AM,08/02/2019 09:40:46 AM,internal.open.piercecountywa.gov,false,0,0,,,,,,,,COM - Pierce County Media Sentiment,pb9r-ib2y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mdt7-nm64,Watersheds,"The County’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System and State Waste Discharge General Permit (NPDES) permit requires that Pierce County maintain mapping data for all known MS4 outfalls and discharge points. The permit requires basin delineation for all tributary conveyances to all known outfalls and discharge points with a 24-inch nominal diameter or larger, or an equivalent cross-sectional area for non-pipe systems.In September 2016, Pierce County Department of Public Works (County) hired Herrera Environmental Consultants (Herrera) to delineate watershed and drainage basin boundaries in GIS to meet the mapping requirements of the current NPDES Phase I Municipal Stormwater Permit. In 2017, Herrera produced an amendment to the original SOW to assist the County with a) conducting a review of 570 existing mapped outfall and discharge points for accuracy and completeness and b)mapping all remaining outfall and discharge points within Pierce County (excluding cities).Herrera has produced a Technical Memorandum documenting all methods and results entitled “Pierce County Drainage Basin and Watershed Delineation Summary Memorandum” (dated December 28, 2017).

cc6w-mz36,Median Home Price,"This dataset uses data provided from Washington State’s Housing Market, a publication of the Washington Center for Real Estate Research (WCRER) at the University of Washington.

Median sales prices represent that price at which half the sales in a county (or the state) took place at higher prices, and half at lower  prices. Since WCRER does not receive sales data on individual transactions (only aggregated statistics),  the median is determined by  the proportion  of sales in a given range of prices required to reach the midway point in the distribution. While  average prices are not reported, they tend to be 15-20 percent above the median.

Movements in sales prices should not be interpreted as appreciation rates. Prices are influenced by changes in cost and changes in the characteristics of homes actually sold. The table on prices by number of bedrooms provides a better measure of appreciation of types of homes than the overall median, but it is still subject to composition issues (such as square footage of home, quality of finishes and size of lot, among others).

There is a degree of seasonal variation in reported selling prices. Prices tend to hit a seasonal peak in summer, then decline through the winter before turning upward again, but home sales prices are not seasonally adjusted. Users are encouraged to limit price comparisons to the same time period in previous years.",Julie Demuth,2v38-cx9u,published,public,approved,official,dataset,Demographics,housing,https://internal.open.piercecountywa.gov/d/cc6w-mz36,https://internal.open.piercecountywa.gov/resource/cc6w-mz36.json,10/11/2018 01:41:44 AM,06/23/2020 07:46:59 PM,06/23/2020 07:46:59 PM,internal.open.piercecountywa.gov,false,642,88,,640,6,openpiercecounty@piercecountywa.gov,See Terms of Use,Washington Center for Real Estate Research,http://realestate.washington.edu/research/wcrer/housing-reports/,,,,,Julie Demuth,,Improve Access to Housing,,,2010,,,,,Vibrant Communities,https://internal.open.piercecountywa.gov/stories/s/t3r8-e9ff,Finance,Annually,,

vc6e-gy6u,Simultaneous Conveyance,"<DIV STYLE=""text-align:Left;font-size:12pt""><P><SPAN>A conveyance is the transferring of legal title of property from person(s) or entity to another. A ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" is the transfer of multiple properties using a single survey document. Examples of this are plats, short plats, condominiums, etc. This data is part of a set of data called ""Land Division - All"". The ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" data contains the current aggregated highest-level formal land divisions (plats, short plats, large lots, etc). Meaning that the most recent ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" type is what is represented in this data. In other words, there are no overlapping ""Simultaneous Conveyances"" in this data, a newer ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" erases what was present before at that location. There are two data sets related to the ""Simultaneous Conveyance"" data: ""SimCon First Division"" and ""SimCon Second Division"". ""SimCon First Division"" contains the next level down of polygons within the ""Simultaneous Conveyance"". For example a plat that contained blocks and lots would only have its blocks in this data. A plat that contained lots and no blocks would have its lots in this data. ""SimCon Second Division"" contains the next level down of polygons within the ""SimCon First Division"" data. For example a plat that contained blocks and lots would have its lots in this data.

9nqp-ukje,Watersheds,"The County’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System and State Waste Discharge General Permit (NPDES) permit requires that Pierce County maintain mapping data for all known MS4 outfalls and discharge points. The permit requires basin delineation for all tributary conveyances to all known outfalls and discharge points with a 24-inch nominal diameter or larger, or an equivalent cross-sectional area for non-pipe systems.In September 2016, Pierce County Department of Public Works (County) hired Herrera Environmental Consultants (Herrera) to delineate watershed and drainage basin boundaries in GIS to meet the mapping requirements of the current NPDES Phase I Municipal Stormwater Permit. In 2017, Herrera produced an amendment to the original SOW to assist the County with a) conducting a review of 570 existing mapped outfall and discharge points for accuracy and completeness and b)mapping all remaining outfall and discharge points within Pierce County (excluding cities).Herrera has produced a Technical Memorandum documenting all methods and results entitled “Pierce County Drainage Basin and Watershed Delineation Summary Memorandum” (dated December 28, 2017).

pyj4-9yu7,Hydro - Centerlines,"This feature class shows streams, centerlines of rivers, centerlines of water bodies, culverts and pipes, and subterranean features. It is an accurate hydrology feature class that was built using the 2011 LIDAR provided by the Puget Sound Lidar Consortium. Also utilized were a combination of orthophotography for both current and historical uses, 2-foot contours (created by the 2011 LIDAR), Department of Natural Resources stream centerlines, adjacent county stream centerlines, and GPS drainage inventory. Each of the sources served a different purpose and combined created more accurate hydrology data for mapping and analysis. All streams manually created. The determination of stream location relied heavily on the 2011 LIDAR and contours while at 1:600 scale or better. After the initial stream creation was completed, the lower quality Department of Natural Resources (DNR) streams were edge-matched to this more accurate Pierce County hydrology layer in Eastern Pierce County around Mount Rainier. Adjacent county streams were edge-matched to the more accurate Pierce County hydrology at Pierce County’s boundary.

6zck-wr5q,Floodplain Cross Sections,"This is 2017 DFIRM Data for cross section lines. New to the DFIRM data is the coastal flood study, that adds Velocity Zones (VE) along Puget Sound and the Seclusion Boundary. Seclusion areas are located where floodplains are affected by non-accredited levees and retain 1970s modeled flood hazards. These lines show the locations of channel surveys used to calculate flood elevations in the hydraulic models. The Cross Sections are also shown on the Flood Profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report and can be used to cross reference the Flood Profiles to the planimetric depiction of the flood hazards. All cross sections for which a spatial location is available should be included in the S_XS table. The Cross Sections are lines generally extending from outside the floodplain, across the entire floodplain and out the other side. In this data set the cross sections have been trimmed to include only the areas show to be in a flood hazard area. Each cross section is represented by a line feature. The line has been split where the modeling shows a different base flood elevation than the stream center on the left or right bank (reference 2017 FIS Volume 2). The Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event (Zones A & V), the 0.2-percent-annual- chance flood event (Zone X shaded), areas of undetermined flood risk (Zone X shaded) and areas of minimal flood risk (Zone X unshaded). The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system. The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000.

s9ke-y5ir,Channel Migration Zone Floodway,"As part of a Channel Migration Zone Study, GeoEngineers, Inc. was contracted by Pierce County, Public Works Surface Water Management formerly “Water Programs” Division to create a series of shapefiles including the SPC_Migration_Potential_Areas.shp.  Pierce_Migration_Potential_Areas.shp combines the include severe, moderate or low migration potential areas. GeoEngineers, Inc. completed migration potential studies of the White, Puyallup and Carbon Rivers (completed 2003 adopted 2005), South Prairie Creek (completed 2005 adopted 2017) and Upper Nisqually River (completed 2007 adopted 2017).  These were accepted by SWM and Adopted by County Council.The MPA delineation involved identifying severe, moderate and low migration potential areas within the delineated CMZ.  The MPA delineation approach is similar to that employed in our CMZ analysis; that future rates and character of migration will be similar to those of the past for similar water discharges, sediment influx, and debris entrainment conditions.  This analysis was also based on the absence of levees, revetments and other confining structures.  The width of each MPA was measured, based on delineation criteria developed specifically for this project, and then adjusted to accommodate geomorphic conditions not accounted for in the maximum migration rates.  Criteria developed for mapping severe, moderate and low MPA are provided in the following paragraphs: Severe MPA includes the area lying inside the HCOT, and an area immediately outside the HCOT boundary equivalent to a distance the channel could travel in a specified period.  The extent of the Severe Migration Potential Area outside the HCOT boundary is determined by two criteria.  The first criterion is the distance the outside channel edge could travel in 10 years of steady lateral migration away from the HCOT boundary (Maximum lateral migration rates multiplied by a ten- year period).  The second is defined by the distance the outside channel edge could travel in storm single event (i.e. maximum overnight rate) from the current channel position (2002).  The landward most boundary of the two criteria defines the Severe Migration Potential Area.Moderate MPA includes areas adjacent to the outside edge of the severe migration potential area.  The width of the moderate migration potential area is determined by the distance the outside channel edge could travel in five years (for South Prairie Creek 10 years) of steady lateral migration beyond the outside edge of the severe migration potential area.  The CMZ boundary will serve as the outside edge of the moderate migration potential boundary at sites where the distance between the severe migration potential boundary and the CMZ boundary represents less the five years (for South Prairie Creek 10 years)of steady lateral migration.  Moderate migration potential areas are not included at sites where the outside edge of the severe migration potential area is determined by the location of the CMZ boundary.  The rate of migration used in the calculation is the maximum average rate of migration for each geomorphic reach (measured as described above).  In some places the width of the Moderate Migration Potential Area may be modified based on geologic interpretation, professional judgment. Low MPA includes areas adjacent to the outside edge of the moderate migration potential area.  The extent of the Low Migration Potential Area beyond the moderate migration potential boundary will be determined by CMZ boundary, as determined by our CMZ evaluation.

quz8-seg6,OLD - Median Home Price Regional Comparison,"This dataset uses data provided from Washington State’s Housing Market, a publication of the Washington Center for Real Estate Research (WCRER) at the University of Washington.

Median sales prices represent that price at which half the sales in a county (or the state) took place at higher prices, and half at lower  prices. Since WCRER does not receive sales data on individual transactions (only aggregated statistics),  the median is determined by  the proportion  of sales in a given range of prices required to reach the midway point in the distribution. While  average prices are not reported, they tend to be 15-20 percent above the median.

Movements in sales prices should not be interpreted as appreciation rates. Prices are influenced by changes in cost and changes in the characteristics of homes actually sold. The table on prices by number of bedrooms provides a better measure of appreciation of types of homes than the overall median, but it is still subject to composition issues (such as square footage of home, quality of finishes and size of lot, among others).

There is a degree of seasonal variation in reported selling prices. Prices tend to hit a seasonal peak in summer, then decline through the winter before turning upward again, but home sales prices are not seasonally adjusted. Users are encouraged to limit price comparisons to the same time period in previous years.",Julie Demuth,2v38-cx9u,published,private,not_ready,official,chart,Demographics,,https://internal.open.piercecountywa.gov/d/quz8-seg6,https://internal.open.piercecountywa.gov/resource/quz8-seg6.json,11/30/2018 05:24:48 AM,01/27/2021 02:25:28 PM,06/23/2020 07:46:59 PM,internal.open.piercecountywa.gov,true,108,0,,,,,See Terms of Use,Washington Center for Real Estate Research,http://realestate.washington.edu/research/wcrer/housing-reports/,,,cc6w-mz36,,,,Improve Access to Housing,2010 to present,,,,,,,Vibrant Communities,https://internal.open.piercecountywa.gov/stories/s/au56-shyd,Finance,Annually,,

cve2-psb5,OLD - Median Home Price Comparison,"This dataset uses data provided from Washington State’s Housing Market, a publication of the Washington Center for Real Estate Research (WCRER) at the University of Washington.

Median sales prices represent that price at which half the sales in a county (or the state) took place at higher prices, and half at lower  prices. Since WCRER does not receive sales data on individual transactions (only aggregated statistics),  the median is determined by  the proportion  of sales in a given range of prices required to reach the midway point in the distribution. While  average prices are not reported, they tend to be 15-20 percent above the median.

Movements in sales prices should not be interpreted as appreciation rates. Prices are influenced by changes in cost and changes in the characteristics of homes actually sold. The table on prices by number of bedrooms provides a better measure of appreciation of types of homes than the overall median, but it is still subject to composition issues (such as square footage of home, quality of finishes and size of lot, among others).

There is a degree of seasonal variation in reported selling prices. Prices tend to hit a seasonal peak in summer, then decline through the winter before turning upward again, but home sales prices are not seasonally adjusted. Users are encouraged to limit price comparisons to the same time period in previous years.",Justin C.

yhua-2j7h,Hydro - Centerlines,"This feature class shows streams, centerlines of rivers, centerlines of water bodies, culverts and pipes, and subterranean features. It is an accurate hydrology feature class that was built using the 2011 LIDAR provided by the Puget Sound Lidar Consortium. Also utilized were a combination of orthophotography for both current and historical uses, 2-foot contours (created by the 2011 LIDAR), Department of Natural Resources stream centerlines, adjacent county stream centerlines, and GPS drainage inventory. Each of the sources served a different purpose and combined created more accurate hydrology data for mapping and analysis. All streams manually created. The determination of stream location relied heavily on the 2011 LIDAR and contours while at 1:600 scale or better. After the initial stream creation was completed, the lower quality Department of Natural Resources (DNR) streams were edge-matched to this more accurate Pierce County hydrology layer in Eastern Pierce County around Mount Rainier. Adjacent county streams were edge-matched to the more accurate Pierce County hydrology at Pierce County’s boundary.
