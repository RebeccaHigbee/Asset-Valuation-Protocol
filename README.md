# Asset-Valuation-Protocol
The Pierce County Asset Valuation Protocol R script is used to flag unused or outdated assets on the County website. By flagging these "low value" assets, content on the Open Data website remains relevant and current. Consequently, the public stays informed and helps keep the County accountable to their goals.

After researching and building the protocol, I created a storypage to explain its purpose. Below is the pdf of the webpage.
